## Database

* What is a database?
  * A set of servers
  * A place to store data
  * A place to store structured data

* What is a `row` in regards to a `database`?
  * Consists of one or more `columns`
  * Contains the actual data required to fullfil a column's `type`
* What is a `table` in regards to a database?
  * A structured set of data
  * Much like a spreadsheet or HTML `<table>` it's a collection of row oriented data
  * A `table` is a specific definition of how to reference data
  * Collection of database `rows` and `columns`
  * Table's `columns` define what data can be inside the table
  * Table's `rows` are the specific data within the table

* In the larger idea relating back to the Python classes we have used a table is
like a class. A column is like attributes. Finally rows are like the values
you give the attributes.
* For now you need not worry about anything other than how to get data in and out of the database.
