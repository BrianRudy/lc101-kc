# Talking points

## Start of Class

1. Welcome back!
2. Class will get harder
    * You must be up-to-date to survive -- it only gets harder
    * Always ask questions
2. Changes:
    * Groups are getting updated
    * We will have less groups overall
    * Less lecture more work together
    * Questions -- only via slack or your teaching fellow
    * We will do _a lot_ more pair programming
    * Mention they are based on feedback of students
    * We will be more time bound (we'll talk more on this Thursday)

## Before we "break out"

1. Any notes from TF sync
2. The final part of the HTML learning for Thursday class
    * Do the last one after you start the CSS (it'll be eaiser)
