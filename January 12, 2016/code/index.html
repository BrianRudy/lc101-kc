        <h1>About me -- a look at Garry Polley</h1>

        <p>
            <span class="text--lead-in">I'm a developer that loves making development</span> easier. Currently, I focus on web development.
            I work client side with JavaScript, though I'm not a fan. I prefer to skip the middle
            layer and go to the back end of a website. Be-it a database or a deployment that niche is what I like
            to fill. I can do Rails and Django development -- preferring Django.
        </p>

        <p>These days I'm also working in Go, which is like a statically typed Python for me.</p>

        <p>
            <span class="text--lead-in">You'll likely see a mix of content on this website</span>, mostly related via blog posts. I generally
            focus on technical posts but every once in awhile I may deviate from my technical nature. Sometimes
            I'll post a "micro" blog, those are mostly notes for myself to remember how to do something.
        </p>

        <p>Thanks for stopping by and feel free to reach out if you need help with anything!</p>
