# Starter Questions

## HTML

2. What's the difference between `ul` and `ol`?
  * ul - is for unordered content
  * ol is for ordered content
3. Where in the HTML document does the `head` go?
  * it is the first "sub" block beneath the `html` element
  * or also said, it's the first element inside of the `html` tag
4. What's the difference between an `inline` element and a `block` element? -- We will continue asking this because it becomes more and more relevant the more we do styling.
  * Inline does not break document flow (e.g. they do not force whitespace)

  1. Type selectors (e.g., h1) and pseudo-elements (e.g., :before).
  2. Class selectors (e.g., .example), attributes selectors (e.g., [type="radio"]) and pseudo-classes (e.g., :hover).
  3. ID selectors (e.g., #example).

  * `font-family`
  * `border`

  * Set `text-align` to `center`.  (i.e. `text-align: center`)

## Git

1. What is a branch?
  * It's a dedicated work area for code
  * Thinking like a tree, it is literally a branch of the main tree
  * It's code within a repo that shares a common history with other code
2. When might I use a branch?
  * For a new feature
  * For deploying specific versions of software
  * To try out different types of code
  * Within launch code for doing studios :smiley:

## General

1. Have you read/started on the next assignment?
2. How is the pace so far? Too fast, not fast enough, just right?
3. What is something you've learned that was exciting? (Garry finds CSS to be pretty cool and fun to work with)
