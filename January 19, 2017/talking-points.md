# Talking points

## Start of Class

* The TFs will look at your assignments
* I'll continue to keep everyone posted on canceled classes
* A lot of work going forward will be in class work -- means coming to class is important
* All work is important, e.g. studios, homework, and assignments

## Before we "break out"

* This is how most classes will be structured going forward
