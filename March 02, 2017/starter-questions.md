# Starter Questions

All questions can have more answers that what is listed here.

## CSharp

* Did any of the fundamentals seem weird from a CSharp standpoint?
  * The `if` syntax?
  * The `for` syntax? How did you like `foreach`?
  * The `switch` statement?
  * The `while` and `do...while`?
* When might you use a `switch` statement?
  * Command line program for parsing arguments (I'll show an small example of this)
  * Comparing "sentinel" integer values (e.g. the day of week example that was given)
* When do you use `foreach` vs `for`?
  * `for` is for generic looping
  * `foreach` is for going over a defined collection
* When would you use `do..while` vs `while`?
  * `do..while` is if you want a specific action to occur each time
  * `while` is for when you only want the action to occur when a specific condition is true
* How are `List` and `Array` different?
  * `Array` is of fixed size (e.g. you have a limited number of elements that can go in it)
  * Changing the size of an `Array` is not allowed
  * An `Array` has faster performance -- though using `List` is liking more common
* What is different about `List` and `Dictionary` in CSharp vs the Python equivalents?
  * The `List` and `Dictionary` in CSharp can only contain elements of the same type

## General

* How was Monday?
* Did you fill out the feedback form?
* Would you like any changes to the format of the class?
* Is covering the code in a different editor okay? Helpful? Harmful? Indifferent?
