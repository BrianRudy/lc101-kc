# CSharp Sample Programs

This repository is a holding for me trying out CSharp development.

Likely there won't be a great deal of code in here worth looking at,
largely these are my personal notes on how to do some things in
C#.

## Getting up and running

Follow the directions here (however) do what homebrew recommends for openssl not what it says.

1. Install VSCode -- https://code.visualstudio.com/download
1. Get the .Net Core -- https://www.microsoft.com/net/core#macos
1. If you use `.zshrc` see this section -- [zsh-issue](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/cli/known-issues.md#users-of-zsh-z-shell-dont-get-dotnet-on-the-path-after-install)
1. Run `dotnet restore` in each of the folders found in here -- only if you plan to run that folder
1. Run `dotnet run` to make the program run, they are simple, so not a lot happens
