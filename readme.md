# LC101 Kansas City

This repository is a place for notes and helpful materials related to the
Launch Code 101 course: https://www.launchcode.org/lc101

Specifically this repository contains the notes and materials used to teach the
LC101 in Kansas City, Missouri for the 2016-2017 fall-winter-spring class.

## Layout

Each folder corresponds to the day the materials are covered in the
lecture portion of the class. This includes but is not limited to
notes, studios, and bonus files.

Files for information will be added early but will not be published
until _after_ each class has physically taken place.
